I am here to tell you stop coding.

Stop.

Really.

Stop.

Take a break and close the laptop.

Have a beer or cup of coffee.

Go hug your significant other.

Sit and watch TV for.

Take the dog for a walk.

Grab a snack.

Do something other than stare at your code editor. I promise VS Code and the algorithm you are perfecting will still be there when you come back. And you'll be a better developer for it.

I know there will be tons of critics to this one because I have been a part of the discussions whenever the topic comes up. But I can honestly say that the best thing I have learned in the previous year or so is that when my work day is done, it is best to close your laptop, and leave the world of code behind.

Too often as developers we place our self worth on the number of lines of code that we write, the number of commits to GitHub, or the number of hours spent in front of the chair. It is not uncommon to hear bragging about the all night code sessions, wearing that time as a badge of honor.

## Coding in your Free Time

Developers are often asked in interviews what they code in their free time, or for personal projects. We don't ask surgeons what kind of surgery they perform in their time off. So why is it acceptable, or even standard, to expect developers to do so. Coding is one of my main interests. It is truly a job that I enjoy and I love to learn more about it, but I am more than my code and the number of hours that I spend crafting it.

Most chefs don't go home and cook a four course meal after a day spent in the kitchen. After eight plus hours coding, it is not what I want to spend my limited free time doing, or should be expected to code more. I have a family, and other interests, or I just simply want to zone out on the couch and watch tv like any other professional. Not coding in your free time should not be seen as a mark against a developer. We all don't have the time, resources, or will to code whenever our eyes are open.

## You're Hurting Yourself

One of the common retorts to this topic is that they are spending their time learning for work or to become a developer.

If it is the latter, I see no problem with this. I went the bootcamp route to become a developer. I was working full-time as the sole breadwinner while coding 30+ hours a week for nine months, with a wife who was pregnant for most of that time. I wouldn't take it back at all because I do have a career that I love. You have to work hard to get what you want.

However, for the former, learning for work, this is detrimental to your standing as an employee, and can lead to you being taken advantage of if not careful. If you are learning for work it is most likely one of two cases, you are new to the industry, or it is new technology that you are not familiar with.

A good employer should understand that if you are new to the industry, you should be given time to learn on the job and foster an environment where you can learn the necessary skills and thrive. Being expected to learn outside of work adds to the already insane pressure that someone who is new to this industry is already feeling.

The same goes for learning new skills, or new tech, even for experienced devs. When introducing new tech, an lengthened time frame is to be expected, and estimates should be made accordingly. The burden should not fall on the dev to work outside of work to catch up.

Our lives are so much more than work. We already spend a majority of our waking hours at work, so the little free time that we do have should be just that, free.

## A Better Rounded Developer

Being a good developer is so much more than just writing code. A good coder has the ability to solve puzzles, communicate, gather information to name a few. Branching out beyond the world of development is a way to give yourself a variety of tools that will help you in the long run to be a better developer.

Reading allows you to become better at combing through documentation. Writing, or blogging will help you to be a better communicator on your team. Playing games and puzzles will help you to look at problems in a new way and from different angles.

The other day while playing with my son, I was able to see the grid structure that was giving me issues while playing with blocks. I see code everywhere, even if I am not coding.

I built a homemade fermentation chamber for homebrewing. This required me to read schematics and search through various blogs and put together something that fit my needs, so no off the shelf model would fit my needs. If this doesn't sound like what a developer does on a daily basis, then I don't know what does. It doesn't have to be code to hone your skills as a developer.

Being a more well-rounded individual will make you better at your job, and a more valuable member of your team.

## Reset Your Brain

I wasn't the most dedicated student during my first few college years. (It is true that youth is wasted on the young.) In order to pass the time in class I used to do the crossword puzzle in the daily newspaper. Usually in the morning class I would get about halfway through and then get stuck. Later on in the day I would pull it out again, and usually finish it in a matter of moments.

Our brains get caught in these lanes and it is difficult to get out. Taking a break, especially when stuck on a problem, can be key. I think most of my Aha moments come in the shower, or while on a hike during lunch.

The same goes for talking to a coworker about the issue. How often have you gone over to a coworkers desk to go over an issue and found the problem within seconds? Having a different point of view is good. Variety is the spice of life.

## Your Mental Health

Burnout is real. It happens to us all, so there is no reason to bring it's onset faster than necessary. Throwing more hours at a problem is not always going to bring the solution. In the long run it can be detrimental to your mental wellbeing.

Coding is something that I love, but it is also something that I can walk away from. My job title is just part of who I am. Taking the time off to focus on my family and be a good father has made me infinitely more happy than any line of code can. Taking a hike at lunch helps me to refocus and get out to be a part of nature and reset my mind. You are more than just the lines of code on your Github profile.

The above image is my Github profile for the past six months. I am proud of my green space on this one. I go hard during the week. My office hours leave me to work that code editor hard. I love to code and learn. I lose track of time during the work day, earning a living at a craft I am passionate about. Fingers moving and code committing.

But my weekends are for my family and hobbies. Free to enjoy the other things that life has to offer. Life is too short to just be a developer. Step away and take a breath. You'll be a better developer for it.
