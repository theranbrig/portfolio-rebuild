      "YZED was conceived as a fashion platform that utilized 3D WebGl models and AR. Using Google's Model Viewer we were able to display 3D models on desktop and mobile devices. On mobile users were able to have experiences that utilized iOS Quick Look and Android Scene Viewer to display augmented reality scenes. Since it was a prototype we chose to use Firebase for a BAAS, however we are looking at a traditional REST API as it moves towards production.",
      'I worked extensively with a design team to implement their vision from the start. Working with SVG and scroll animations was a great way to incorporate new techniques.  We also worked on creating the UI to create something that would be web friendly, while still maintaining their design vision.',

      'This project was to bring five years of sales records for our retail store that were kept on spreadsheets into the 21st century with a live sales, history, and inventory tracking.  We first had to work on creating data models for all of the old sales and the new sales records. After that we were able to create a frontend interface. We also built a system for uploading old sales data via spreadsheets. The final part was working with the store to create a sales report system and inventory tracking that would work for them.  It included sales, deliveries and tracking, history, and inventory.  We ended up digitizing more than 40,000 sales and inventory items from the past five years.',
      'My role was quite large in this project.  I was essentially working on all of the Create, Update, and Destroy on the store side. I built the frontend and backend business logic for the sales, deliveries, inventory, scheduling, and history.',
      'I ended up taking on the design system as well in this one.  We were using drag and drop UI editor that management had wanted to test out, but most of their components did not fit the styling from our UX designer. This meant a lot of custom CSS had to be implemented.  It also meant that several custom Cordova plugins and custom jQuery for the drag and drop framework had to be built to meet our needs in frontend functionality.',

This was part of my curriculum with Bloc.io and was a great experience in learning the concepts of how to build a React app. The app was first built by creating a list of chat rooms that dynamically updates when a user adds a new chat room. After that, displayed messages for each chat room were generated.',
  //     'In order to create messages as a registered user, Firebase was added for user authentication and to save messages for each user. All messages only display within the given chat room in which they were created. Messages and chat rooms may be deleted and edited when necessary.',
  //     'The page was styled using Material UI. It is mobile responsive, though it is best used on a desktop platform. This was my first time using a database with React and it was a good experience in further learning React and showing the power that it has when used with a dynamic database like Firebase.',
